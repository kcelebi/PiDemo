# PiDemo

Consider a scenario where on a frictionless plane are a wall on the left and two blocks, the red one being of mass 1 kg and the other of mass 100^N kilograms. These blocks collide elastically (we're assuming no loss of energy from heat or sound) a couple of times, until the black block floats out to infinity towards the right. Interestingly, the counts of the number of collisions is equal to π * 10^N, in other words, N digit approximation of π.

This repository contains my demonstration of this using Processing. The main file is in the folder ``newerfasterbetter``. The folder pisim contains pre-calculated coordinates for the blocks for smoother compilation. In the processing file, you can change N to see different approximations of π (the range I have calculated is from N in [1,4]). 

Expect an interactive JavaScript version to come soon!
